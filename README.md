This game was originally called Count to Omnipotent. You'll see some leftover files, mostly from Visual Studio but also some other configurations, with this name. Don't bother opening the .sln files, just open the prototypingScene.unity file like the instructions say.

Want to play the game? The "executable" folder has a compiled version that should work at least on Windows. You can also try it here: http://web.ist.utl.pt/ist170554/MDJ/blog/prototypes/prototype3/index.html
