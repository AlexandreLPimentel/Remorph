This is a Unity project. It was created using version 5.6.1f1 and ported to 2020.3.11f1 with commit 3ad2f6c6b8eae3fdf2b54d7b469847c0044d0a4d.
To open it, go into the Assets folder and open prototypingScene.unity. This is the only scene and it's empty since levels are generated in runtime. It will take a while launching because it will need to create the Library folder.
To check the levels, go to Assets/Resources/Levels.
To check the assets, it's better to launch Unity and go to the Project tab and then into the Resources folder.
To check the C# code, go to Assets/Scripts.
Note that GhostFreeRoam is not developed by me and was used only during early stages of development to fly around the level.
