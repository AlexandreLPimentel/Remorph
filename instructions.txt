This is a Unity project. It was originally created using version 5.6.1f1 and has been ported to more recent versions a few times.
To open it, go into the Assets folder and open prototypingScene.unity. This is the only scene and it's empty since levels are generated in runtime. It will take a while launching because it will need to create the Library folder.
To check the levels, go to Assets/Resources/Levels.
To check the assets, it's better to launch Unity and go to the Project tab and then into the Resources folder.
To check the C# code, go to Assets/Scripts.
Note that GhostFreeRoam is not developed by me and was used only during early stages of development to fly around the level.
